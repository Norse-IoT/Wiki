This is the official wiki for Norse IoT club, containing getting started guides and project notes.

Edit access to this Wiki is available upon request. Contact one of our Officers in the Discord and we'll add you to the GitHub. An editing guide is coming to the Wiki soon.

## What's this Wiki?

The goal of this wiki is to be a one stop shop for concrete information, including tips for getting started with projects, and links to useful long term resources about our projects.
