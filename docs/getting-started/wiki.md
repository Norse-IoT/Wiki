# Getting Started - Wiki Editing

This section of the getting started guide will cover how to edit the Norse IoT Club Wiki.

The Norse IoT Wiki makes use of Mkdocs to create a space for long term project documentation. Project notes are written in Markdown. Markdown is an open file format that's easy to read and write. Variants of Markdown are used used by GitHub, Reddit, Discord, and more. You can familiarize yourself with the basics of Markdown with the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org). The Wiki also supports writing direct HTML, if Markdown doesn't work for your specific idea.

You'll notice that every page on the Wiki (including this one!) has an "Edit on GitHub" button in the bottom left corner. Once you've joined the club's GitHub, you can click this button to view this page on GitHub. On GitHub, you can click the edit button in the top right corner, and you'll be taken to an editing view. You can type your notes as normal, and use the Preview button above the text editor to confirm that links and images work correctly.

Once you're done, you can click the green "Commit changes..." button to make your change public to the Wiki!
