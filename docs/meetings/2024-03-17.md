# 2024-03-17 - Ruby on Rails

Today, we're going to be briefly dipping our toes into Ruby on Rails.

Ruby on Rails is a great way to build a website as a solo developer.

Ruby on Rails was initially released in 2004, and is widely used across [many big companies](https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Ruby-on-Rails/Historical).

Today, we're going to demo of the power of Ruby on Rails.  Then, we'll start with the basics of Ruby.

This is what we will be using today:

## Demo

You don't need to follow along with this. This is to serve as a motivation as to *why* to learn Ruby/Ruby on Rails.

### Installation

You can install Ruby on Rails here: <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/install_ruby_on_rails.html>

### Creating a project

Let's create a new project!

This project is going to be themed around Sam's Rat Tickling certification.

We can run:

```bash
rails new ratcert
```

To create a new project called "ratcert".

This follows the "Convention over Configuration" part of [Rail's doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine). They know what you'll need, so they add it for you.

In this basic project, you get your Model, View, and Controller (MVC), as well as your mailers (for email), jobs (for background jobs), and [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/).

So, now we have a basic project, ready to go!

### Let's start modelling!

Our project is going to represent a few basic parts of a website built to manager rat tickling certifications.

Let's create the ability to keep track of rats.

One of the superpowers of Ruby on Rails is its [code "scaffolds"](https://www.rubyguides.com/2020/03/rails-scaffolding/).

We can run:

```
rails generate scaffold rat name:string birthday:date
```

To generate a rat that has a string name, and a birthday date.

You can see all the files this created in the output of the command.

Now, we can run:

```bash
rails db:migrate # create the rat structure in the database
rails server # start the server
```

You should be greeted with something like this:

We can navigate to `/rats` to see a list of our rats.

We can click "new rat" to create a rat.

I'll demo some more features of the webui here.

But, let's take a second to see where this comes from.

The scaffold has created some views, which we can interact with:

![list of files in vscode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a4db638-5273-4947-9c27-9f798a9bf8ed)


The scaffold has also created a database migration:

```ruby
class CreateRats < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
  def change
    create_table :rats do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.date :birthday

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

This is another power of ruby: to abstract away the database you're using.
