# 2024-03-17 - Ruby on Rails

Today, we're going to be briefly dipping our toes into Ruby on Rails.

Ruby on Rails is a great way to build a website as a solo developer.

Ruby on Rails was initially released in 2004, and is widely used across [many big companies](https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Ruby-on-Rails/Historical).

Today, we're going to demo of the power of Ruby on Rails.  Then, we'll start with the basics of Ruby.

This is what we will be using today:

## Demo

You don't need to follow along with this. This is to serve as a motivation as to *why* to learn Ruby/Ruby on Rails.

### Installation

You can install Ruby on Rails here: <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/install_ruby_on_rails.html>

### Creating a project

Let's create a new project!

This project is going to be themed around Sam's Rat Tickling certification.

We can run:

```bash
rails new ratcert
```

To create a new project called "ratcert".

This follows the "Convention over Configuration" part of [Rail's doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine). They know what you'll need, so they add it for you.

In this basic project, you get your Model, View, and Controller (MVC), as well as your mailers (for email), jobs (for background jobs), and [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/).

So, now we have a basic project, ready to go!

### Let's start modelling!

Our project is going to represent a few basic parts of a website built to manager rat tickling certifications.

Let's create the ability to keep track of rats.

One of the superpowers of Ruby on Rails is its [code "scaffolds"](https://www.rubyguides.com/2020/03/rails-scaffolding/).

We can run:

```
rails generate scaffold rat name:string birthday:date
```

To generate a rat that has a string name, and a birthday date.

You can see all the files this created in the output of the command.

Now, we can run:

```bash
rails db:migrate # create the rat structure in the database
rails server # start the server
```

You should be greeted with something like this:

We can navigate to `/rats` to see a list of our rats.

![listing of rats, offering to create a new rat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd6c0e1f-e70b-4cad-89c8-df9417740360)

We can click "new rat" to create a rat.

I'll demo some more features of the webui here.

But, let's take a second to see where this comes from.

The scaffold has created some views, which we can interact with:

![list of files in vscode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a4db638-5273-4947-9c27-9f798a9bf8ed)


The scaffold has also created a database migration:

```ruby
class CreateRats < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
  def change
    create_table :rats do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.date :birthday

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

This is another power of ruby: to abstract away the database you're using. 

Read more about this here: <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#migration-overview>

Note that this is bi-directional, so that this can both create and destroy these fields in our database.

We also created a Rat, which just inherits everything from the database:

```ruby
# this is our "model"
class Rat < ApplicationRecord
end
```

It's also created a controller in `./app/controllers/rats_controller.rb` that we should look through and explain.

## Creating a Tickler!

So, rats can be tickled by one person, and each person may tickle many rats.

We can create a Tickler like this:

```ruby
rails generate scaffold tickler name:string email:uniq
rails db:migrate
```

This means each tickler has a name, which it uses as its index ([read more here](https://medium.com/@mera.stackhouse/what-are-indexes-and-how-to-add-them-to-your-rails-app-dc066d538771)), and an email which must be unique.

For more info on associations, read this: <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html>

#### Improving our Tickler

At this point, we can just put anything into our form.

That's not great, let's add some validations!

We can add these lines to the model, to ensure any new data is valid:

```ruby
class Tickler < ApplicationRecord
  # validates that the name is present
  validates_presence_of :name

  # validate that the email exists, and is in the right format
  validates_uniqueness_of :email
  validates :email, format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }
end
```

(Here's the bit where Zack demonstrates this at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/ticklers`)

#### Creating a relationship

So, let's define a relationship between our rats and rat ticklers.

The documentation at <https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#types-of-associations> is great, so read that first.

Then, let's create a one-to-many relationship:

(I think IRL this should be a [many-to-many relationship](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#has-and-belongs-to-many), but that's a little complex for right now.)

```ruby
class Rat < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :tickler
end
```

```ruby
class Tickler < ApplicationRecord
  # validates that the name is present
  validates_presence_of :name

  # validate that the email exists, and is in the right format
  validates_uniqueness_of :email
  validates :email, format: { with: URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP }


  has_many :rats
end
```

Now let's update the views to show this relationship:

##### Rats

```ruby
# app/views/rats/_form.html.erb
<div>
  <%= form.label :tickler_id, style: "display: block" %>
  <%= form.collection_select :tickler_id, Tickler.all, :id, :name, prompt: true %>
</div>
```

```ruby
# app/views/rats/show.html.erb
<div>
  <strong>Tickler:</strong>
  <%= @rat.tickler&.name %>
</div>
```

##### Ticklers

```
# app/views/ticklers/show.html.erb
<h2>Rats</h2>
<ul>
  <% @tickler.rats.each do |rat| %>
    <li><%= link_to "Rat ##{rat.id}", rat %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

<%= link_to 'New Rat', new_rat_path(tickler_id: @tickler.id) %>
```

Also, we need to create a field on our Rat that associates it with a Tickler. We can do so here:

```bash
rails generate migration AddTicklerIdToRats tickler_id:integer
```

And we need to update the controller's expected parameters:

```ruby
# app/controllers/rats_controller.rb
  private
    # Use callbacks to share common setup or constraints between actions.
    def set_rat
      @rat = Rat.find(params.expect(:id))
    end

    # Only allow a list of trusted parameters through.
    def rat_params
      params.expect(rat: [ :name, :birthday, :tickler_id ])
    end
```

## More Power: Like LLMs?

I found this recently, and thought it highlighted the beauty of both Ruby and Rails:

<https://github.com/crmne/ruby_llm?tab=readme-ov-file#rails-integration-that-makes-sense>

I thought the tool feature was very nice.
