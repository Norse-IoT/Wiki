# 2025-02-17 - Let's learn MicroPython


What's the difference between MicroPython and CircuitPython:

- **MicroPython** is a flexible and memory-efficient Python implementation for microcontrollers, supporting a wide range of hardware with advanced features but requiring manual setup.  
- **CircuitPython** is a beginner-friendly fork of MicroPython, designed for ease of use with Adafruit hardware, offering plug-and-play functionality and built-in libraries.

Today, we're working with MicroPython.
