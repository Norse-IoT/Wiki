# Project Freezerburn
This project was originally pitched by Professor Sarah Mann for the IoT Club as a way to detect when her freezers were open. Sarah Mann owns a farm in Kentucky that has multiple freezers spread across several buildings, so any solution would need to be scalable.

@rweberhorowitz is our point of contact for Sarah Mann on this project. 

## Deliverables
- Push notifications when freezers are left open
- Status page where freezer status (open/closed) can be viewed.
- Additional data when possible, including temperature over time.

## Solutions

- Read switches to detect open/closed with magnetic force.
- Roll ball switch embedded in door (requires door modification, may not be ideal on a climate controlled freezer)
- Limit switch

## Open Questions
- What types of freezers does she have?
- How many freezers does she have?
- Can integrate with existing smart home systems, or use the Matter protocol?
- Do we want an app to send push notifications?
