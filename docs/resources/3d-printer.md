# 3d Printer

> This is a _draft_

The printer we have is a Original Prusa MK4

## Nametag Project
As an example project to practice 3d printing, you can make a nametag at <https://www.nametag-designer.com/>, which will give you a `.stl` file.

Then, you can reference [the PRUSA documentation](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/download-prusaslicer_2220) and the [official download link](https://help.prusa3d.com/downloads) to download the Prusa Slicer for your operating system.

You're going to want the one for the "ORIGINAL PRUSA MK4".

<aside>
I (Zack Sargent) tested [version 2.7.4](https://cdn.prusa3d.com/downloads/drivers/prusa3d_linux_2_7_4.zip) under "DRIVERS & APPS 2.7.4" on Fedora Linux.

The appimage "`PrusaSlicer-2.7.4+linux-x64-GTK3-202404050928.AppImage`" worked perfectly first time for me.

## Setting up the printer's slicer

Install this to your system, if available:

Select the default:

Unless you have more configurations to make, press <kbd> Finish </kbd>

## Adding your file

I left everything as the default, and clicked "<kbd>Export G-Code</kbd>".

Then, I got a G-Code file that the printer was able to print, after I put it on a flashdrive.
